"""Runtime configuration for the dashboard service.

There are no secrets in this project. It reads capture files off disk and talks
to nobody -- there is no API key, no token, no database credential and no
account to authenticate against. `.env` here holds *deployment settings* (bind
address, paths, tuning), which is a different thing from a secrets file, and
`.env.example` documents them.

Deliberately NOT imported by the detection path. `engine.py` and everything
under ingest/ features/ detectors/ alerts/ take their settings from CLI flags
and open exactly one file: the capture. Reading an environment file there would
put a second descriptor into a code path whose entire claim is that it opens
one, and tools/isolation_check.py layer 3 would have to be weakened to allow it.

So the split is: **CLI flags configure the analyser, environment configures the
service.** `python engine.py --window 10` still works exactly as before and is
unaffected by anything in this file.
