"""Train and validate the anomaly model.

    python train.py --normal data/pcaps/normal.pcap --out models/anomaly.joblib

Training set: benign traffic ONLY. The model never sees an attack during fit.
That is not a shortcut -- it reflects what a passive monitor can actually
collect. You can record a quiet week off a production link; you cannot record a
labelled corpus of attacks against your own infrastructure on demand.

Validation therefore cannot be "accuracy on a held-out labelled set" in the
supervised sense. Instead we score the labelled attack captures and ask whether
the attacking host's windows separate from the benign ones (ROC-AUC), which is
the honest question to ask of an unsupervised density model.

Scope note, stated plainly: the feature vector is per-SOURCE-host, so this model
addresses threats where one source behaves unusually -- scanning, beaconing,
tunnelling, exfiltration. It does NOT address spoofed-source SYN floods, where
every source appears exactly once and the anomaly lives at the target. That
class is covered by detectors/synflood.py on behavioural evidence, and no claim
is made here that the model contributes to it.
