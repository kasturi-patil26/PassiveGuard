"""The machine-learning component: unsupervised anomaly scoring.

Why it exists, plainly: the rule detectors alongside it encode threats we already
know how to describe. This model encodes what *normal* looks like on this link,
so traffic that is merely strange still surfaces. It complements the evidence;
it never overrides it.

Model      IsolationForest (sklearn), 200 trees.
Trained on Benign windows only -- see docs/MODEL.md. Training never sees an
           attack, which matters for a passive monitor: you can collect quiet
           traffic from a production link, but you cannot collect labelled
           attacks from one.
Features   The 10-dimension per-host vector in features/extract.host_vector.
Output     A calibrated 0..1 anomaly score. High = unlike anything in training.

The score does two jobs:
  1. it is attached to every rule-based alert as corroboration, and
  2. above a high threshold it raises a low-severity ANOMALOUS_FLOW on its own.

Deliberately NOT done: no deep network, no packet-bytes-as-tensor model, no
claim that the model understands protocols. It is a density estimate over ten
hand-engineered features, which is what the evidence can actually support.

    means "more unusual than anything in the benign training data" -- a claim

    An earlier version anchored 1.0 at the benign 1st percentile, which
    guaranteed by construction that ~1% of benign windows would score at the top

    anchor moved to the benign minimum specifically to make the anomaly channel
