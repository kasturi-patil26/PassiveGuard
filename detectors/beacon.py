"""Detector #3 -- Botnet C2 beaconing.

The only detector here that fundamentally cannot work inside a single window: a
30-second beacon is invisible in a 5-second slice. It keeps a rolling per-pair
timing series across windows, which is the concrete reason the whole pipeline is
built around stateful detectors instead of per-window batch jobs.

Signal: a (source -> destination:port) pair contacted repeatedly with low
variance in inter-arrival time. Periodicity is measured as the coefficient of
variation of the IAT series (std / mean) -- scale-free, so it catches a 30s
beacon and a 300s beacon with the same threshold.

Real malware jitters deliberately, so the threshold tolerates roughly +/-15%.
Beyond that, timing stops being distinguishable from human-driven traffic and we
would rather miss it than flood the analyst with false positives.
