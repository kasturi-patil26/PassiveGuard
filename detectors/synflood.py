"""Detector #1 -- Volumetric / protocol DDoS (SYN flood, spoofed-source flood).

The signature is read at the *target*, not the source: a victim absorbing SYNs
far above its learned baseline while almost none of those SYNs draw an observed
SYN/ACK. Source-IP entropy separates a spoofed flood (many one-shot sources,
near-maximum entropy) from a single aggressive client (low entropy).

Note the completion ratio is something we *observe*, never something we test.
Completing a handshake ourselves would need a return path we do not have.
